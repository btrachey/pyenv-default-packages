# pyenv-default-packages

This pyenv plugin hooks into the `pyenv install` and `pyenv virtualenv`
commands to automatically install packages every time you install a new
version of Python or create a new virtualenv.

Forked from the excellent [`rbenv-default-gems`][1] plugin from [sstephenson][2].

## Installation

### Installing as a pyenv plugin

Make sure you have the latest pyenv version, then run:

    git clone https://github.com/btrachey/pyenv-default-packages.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-default-packages

### Installing with Homebrew (for OS X users)

Mac OS X users can install pyenv-default-packages with the
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager.

*This is the recommended method of installation if you installed pyenv
 with Homebrew.*

```
$ brew install btrachey/pyenv/pyenv-default-packages
```

Or, if you would like to install the latest development release:

```
$ brew install --HEAD btrachey/pyenv/pyenv-default-packages
```

## Usage

pyenv-default-packages automatically installs the packages listed in the
`$(pyenv root)/default-packages` file every time you successfully install a new
version of Python with `pyenv install` or create a virtualenv with
`pyenv virtualenv`.

Specify packages in `$(pyenv root)/default-packages` by name, one per line. This
file should follow the pip [requirements file format][3]. For example:

    pytest >= 2.6.4
    futures; python_version < '2.7'
    http://my.package.repo/SomePackage-1.0.4.zip; python_version >= '3.4'

A line that begins with `#` is treated as a comment and ignored. Whitespace
followed by a `#` causes the `#` and the remainder of the line to be treated
as a comment.
